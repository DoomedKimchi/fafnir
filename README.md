## Structure: ##
Our code is split into the following two directories:
<br>

- **_Robot/_** - Program that runs on the Robot and controls all of its functionality
<br>
- **_Pi/_** - Vision tracking code to track targets
<br>

See readme files in each directory for more details.
<br>

## Main Branches: ##
- **_master_**	Most development goes here
<br>
- **_stable_**	100% functional, stable code for use in competitions
<br>

### Temporary Branches: ###
- **_testnetwork_**	Testing TCP messaging server/client model to use vision tracking on Raspberry Pi during Autonomous mode
<br>

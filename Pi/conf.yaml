PixelToCM: 414.6868
DistanceAtFull: 10

# How PixelToCM is calculated:
# let d be the distance between the camera and the target (in centimeters)
# let t be the width of the target in pixels from the camera
# let w be the width of the image from the camera
# r = 1 - t/w
# PixelToCM = d/r

# DistanceAtFull is the distance (in centimeters) that the camera
# is from the target when the target takes up the whole frame
# (width wise, not height wise)
